You put in the customScripts.lua file require("custom/testtimercleanerhopefully4") and put all the script files into the custom folder. and you put the .esp file into your morrowind data files folder and then put {"dwemerruintesttogether.ESP": ["0xD4EA8A0B"]} into the requiredDataFiles.json file in the server/data folder. if you wanted to host a server with these files running on it. if you wanted to join a server that is using the .esp file, then you would just need to put the .esp file into your morrowind data files folder and then activate the .esp in the openmw launcher by clicking on the box next to it listed in the data files section. I hope this is somehow helpful.. so complicated..
