If you want to join a server that is using the .ESP file, then you would just need to put the .ESP file into your Morrowind data files folder and then activate the .ESP in the Openmw launcher by clicking on the box next to it listed in the "data files" section. If you wanted to run a server using these files, then you put in the customScripts.lua file, require("custom/testtimercleanerhopefully4"), and put all the script files into the "custom" folder, and you put the .ESP file into your Morrowind data files folder and then put, {"dwemerruintesttogether.ESP": ["0xD4EA8A0B"]}, into the "requiredDataFiles.json" file in the server/data folder. I hope this is somehow helpful.. so complicated..
